Abstract:
Urban vibrancy, the dynamic activity of humans in urban environments, is shaped by a complex interplay of urban features, social conditions, and demographic factors. This talk explores how urban vibrancy varies across genders and its implications for gender segregation within cities. Traditional studies have often overlooked the nuanced, high-frequency interactions that characterize urban life.

Our study addresses this gap by leveraging Call Detail Record (CDR) data, offering unprecedented insights into the spatial behaviors of residents across seven major cities in Italy. By analyzing these data, we uncover distinct patterns in urban vibrancy between males and females. We find that these differences are influenced significantly by 'Points of Interest' and transportation networks, highlighting the role of accessibility and opportunities in shaping urban experiences.

Moreover, our spatial modeling approach reveals both positive and negative 'spatial spillovers' across urban features, underscoring their impact on gender-specific urban dynamics. These findings not only deepen our understanding of urban inequality but also offer pathways toward creating more equitable cities in the future.

Key Points Covered:

Gender Differences in Urban Vibrancy: Exploration of how males and females experience urban environments differently in terms of activity and interaction.

Impact of Urban Features: Analysis of the direct effects of 'Points of Interest' and transportation networks on urban vibrancy and gender-specific behaviors.

Spatial Spillovers: Examination of how urban features influence adjacent areas, affecting gender dynamics and potentially contributing to segregation.

Methodological Approach: Utilization of Call Detail Record data to provide high-frequency observations, enhancing the granularity of urban studies.

Implications for Future Cities: Insights into designing more inclusive urban spaces that cater to diverse demographic needs and promote social equity.

This talk contributes to ongoing discussions on urban planning and social policy by offering a data-driven perspective on gender dynamics within cities. By identifying key factors influencing urban vibrancy and segregation, we aim to inform strategies for building fairer and more responsive urban environments.
