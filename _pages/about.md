Welcome to my research website. I am a Comuputational social sciences Doctoral Researcher based at the University of Exeter in the South West of UK.

### Human behaviour

I am working with [Federico Botta](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/staff/fb394?sm=fb394), Riccardo Di Clemente, and Mario Gutierrez-Roig to model urban environments using novel born-digital data sources (such as mobile phone and internet data) to visualise human behaviour. My current research uses an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates network theory and computer sciences to analyse large data sources to better understand urban vibrancy; the energetic activity in an urban environment. The potential outputs of this are an understanding of how city size and urban morphology relates to social, environmental, health or economic inequalities. Our work is funded by UK Research and innovation, which is a partnership program for postgraduate scholarships

### Movement ecology

Outside of CEMPS, I work with Mike Cant, and Dan Sankey within the Socialis Research group to model animal movement using continuous time movement modelling approaches to quantify the changes of home ranges. The aim of this project is to better understand the context related to collective behaviours of animals and the relationship collective behaviours have with the evolution of social behaviour in animals.
