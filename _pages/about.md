Welcome to my research website. I am a Comuputational social sciences Doctoral Researcher based at the University of Exeter in the South West of UK.

### Human behaviour

I work within the University of Exeter's [Faculty of Environment, Science, and Economy (ESE)](<https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/ourfaculties/ese/>) in the  [Department of Computer Sciences](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/research/). Currently, I am working with [Federico Botta](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/staff/fb394?sm=fb394), [Riccardo Di Clemente](http://www.riccardodiclemente.com/), and [Mario Gutierrez-Roig](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/gutie81607/mario-gutierrez-roig) to model urban environments using novel born-digital data sources (such as mobile phone and internet data) to visualise human behaviour.

My current research uses an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates network theory and computer sciences to analyse large data sources to better understand urban vibrancy; the energetic activity in an urban environment. The potential outputs of this are an understanding of how city size and urban morphology relates to social, environmental, health, or economic inequalities. Our work is funded by UK Research and innovation, which is a partnership program for postgraduate scholarships.

### Movement ecology

Outside of the ESE, I work with Professor [Mike Cant](), and [Dan Sankey]() within the [Socialis Research group](http://socialisresearch.org/) to model animal movement using continuous time movement modelling approaches to quantify the changes of home ranges. The aim of this project is to better understand the context related to collective behaviours of animals and the relationship collective behaviours have with the evolution of social behaviour in animals.

### Animal cognition

I have also investigated how urban life affects herring gull behaviour, diet, health and survival with [Project C-Gull](https://projectcgull.com/)  and [Neeltje Boogert](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Neeltje_Boogert)
