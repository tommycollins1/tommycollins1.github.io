Welcome to my research website. I am a Doctoral Researcher based at the University of Exeter in the South West of UK. I work within the University of Exeter's [Faculty of Environment, Science, and Economy (FESE)](<https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/ourfaculties/ese/>) in the  [Department of Computer Sciences](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/research/).

### Collective behaviour human behaviour...
I am currently working to model urban environments using novel born-digital data sources (such as [Call Detail Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record) data) to visualise human behaviour. My research focuses on the intersection of urban planning, data science, and technology, with a particular emphasis on the use of advanced analytics to inform decision-making and policy development to improve the health and well-being of people living in urban areas. My current research uses an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates Computational Social Sciences methodologies to analyse large data sources. The potential outputs of this research are an increased understanding of the relationship between urban vibrancy--the energetic activity in an urban environment--and gender segregation. Our work is funded by UK Research and innovation, which is a partnership program for postgraduate scholarships.

### Movement ecology
Outside of the FESE, I work within the [Socialis Research group](http://socialisresearch.org/) to model animal movement. To do this, I use *continuous time movement modelling* approaches to quantify the changes of home ranges. The aim of this animal movement data project is to better understand the context related to collective behaviours of animals and the relationship between collective behaviours and the evolution of social behaviour.

### Human-wildlife conflict
In my previous work with [Project C-Gull](https://projectcgull.com/), I investigated how urban environments affects herring gull behaviour, diet, health and survival.
