We can use urban vibrancy to understand how people use cities but also how cities might hold segregation.

What is the link between urban features and urban vibrancy and does this
differ for different social groups? To what extent does this result in spatial segregation in cities? More broadly, can we use Call Detail Records to understand these factors and can quantitative methodologies be used to help ameliorate inequality in cities?

Our findings indicate that there are discrepancies between males and females in regard to urban vibrancy. These variances are linked to both transportation networks and 'Points of Interest.' Furthermore, we observed the presence of favorable and unfavorable 'spatial spillovers' in each city.
